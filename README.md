# WomenSafety-AntiSoch
Problem Statement- “Sexual harassment is a common problem faced by women
in both personal and professional environments.”

Develop a solution that addresses preventive and post-event action for sexual
harassment along with a feature to collect information about offenders and report them
accordingly. The system should also ensure data privacy and implement complete
anonymity if and when required.
Hints:
● Product may contain location detection and Alert /SOS systems. Can add
features such as voice recording and emergency contacts.
● Interface may be able to detect any such abusive activity on social media as well.
● Can add a feature to carry out historical analysis and predictive analysis to
identify potential trollers and report them if needed.
